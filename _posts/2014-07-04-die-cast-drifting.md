My brother and I invented a game years ago at our Grandmother's house. We cleared
off the table and grabbed a few Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars and started pushing
them at each other. We discovered that we could drift the car down the length of
the table and make it turn during the course of its run. So we started adding
obstacles. And so we have the game as it is today, at my own house with my
kid's cars. It may be stupid fun, but that's how we roll.
