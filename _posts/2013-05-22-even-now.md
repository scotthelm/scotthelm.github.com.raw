Even now  
I can hear my heartbeat in my ears  
the need to get the words out  
before it's too late  
  
Even now  
there's so much more I want to tell you  
in the midnight confessional  
the silent return  
  
Even now  
I wish I could see through your eyes  
standing on the shore with the boatman  
looking back over your shoulder  
  
Even now  
Even still  
  
I always think of you when I least expect it  
like a flash in my periphery  
that draws my eye  
and I sit there, rapt for a while searching  
searching for what's no longer there  
  
Even now  
Even still
