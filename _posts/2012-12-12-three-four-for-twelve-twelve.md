##Three Four for Twelve Twelve
***
It being 12/12/12, I was put in mind of 3/4 time, of course.  

Here are a few songs in that time signature (technically, some are in 6/8, but if I can count it in threes, I count it.  This list is just off the top of my head, and is in no particular order...and yes, there are 2 Queen songs.  Sue me.

* [She's Leaving Home - Beatles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lG3nXyI41M)
* [Manic Depression - Jimi Hendirx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvfzrffto2I)
* [Birdland - Patti Smith](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47leRbuaOxo)
* [My Favorite Things - John Coltrane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWG2dsXV5HI)
* [Drowse - Queen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1G1xZsLb3c)
* [Dead Melodies - Beck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwXtHZeBb7M)
* [Nude - Radiohead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ky1td3_6LY)
* [We Are The Champions - Queen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY)
* [Christmas Time Is Here - Charlie Brown Christmas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPG3zSgm_Qo)

interestingly, [Waltzing Matilda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrkThaBWa5c) isn't in 3/4 unless you count it in triplets.  But hey, it's a great song, so I'm including it.

Enjoy your 12/12/12!
