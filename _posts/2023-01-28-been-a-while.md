It's been a while, and a lot has changed. I lost my father. I changed jobs. I wrote some more music. I stopped consuming social media (recently - more to come on that).I've decided that the best way for me to engage is with RSS. I'm currently evaluating <a href="https://feedly.com">Feedly</a>, and I'll post about that when I have a better handle on it. I realized that I miss the google reader a lot. 

My new year's goal is to be more intentional with my time, and keeping up with this site, and getting into shape again. We'll see how it goes.

All I know right now is that I am happy and healthy and that being blissfully unaware of the outrage machine is helping me stay that way.
