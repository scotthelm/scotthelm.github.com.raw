This is a song I wrote for my mom. My sister found a picture of her and me
dancing at my wedding. It was a beautiful gift. 

I had started the melody a while back, but had no lyrics.  I put the lyrics
together today.

in a corner of the room  
underneath the moving boxes  
in a chest of faded memories there  
is a picture of us dancing  

after all this time flows  
out the door and through the windows  
through these tears I look up  
and see rainbows  

I often think of you  
in my mind I see you smiling  
like a vision of the loveliest smile  
that anyone has ever  

after all this time flows  
out the door and through the windows  
through these tears I look up  
and see rainbows
